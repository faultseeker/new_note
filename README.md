# The New Note
This is one of two plugins for [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/) that automate the folgezettel naming convention.

The New Note plugin produces a note within the current sequence of notes.

The plugin looks for the Folgezettel ID in the filename, extracts it, and creates a new note with the filename based on the current note, selected in The Archive.
